<!-- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags -->

<!-- The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.-->

<!-- <head> before the body element you will often see a <head> element This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 
You will usually find a <title> 
element inside the <head> 
element.-->

<!-- <title> The contents of the <title> 
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page (if your 
browser uses tabs to allow you 
to view multiple pages at the 
same time). -->

<!-- The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing tag should be shown inside the main browser window. -->

<!-- Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading -->

<!-- A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags -->

<!-- Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading. -->

<!-- Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign. -->
